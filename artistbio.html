  <p>I'm Billie Wynn, from New York City, and am currently getting my BFA at the Rhode Island School of Design as a painting major. My artistic journey intertwines painting, photography, printmaking, video, and sculpture. From assisting artists to working in the gallery and woodshop at school, I've embraced a multidisciplinary approach. Studying at RISD since 2021, my art has left its mark in various exhibitions, including the one I just curated at Memorial Hall called "Chipwitch," which is an all collaborative show. Notable showcases of mine include a feature in the 2024 “Spring Mix” at the Renwick FAS Viewing Room, Winter 2023 "Major Survey Show" at Gelman Gallery, "End Of The Year'' at Brown/RISD Hillel, "Give and Take" at Memorial Hall and "Dreamhaus" at Carr Haus. I have also assisted artists like Rebecca Manson on her beautiful clay leaf sculptures which were on display at Art Basel 2021 and have helped on photoshoots for As If… magazine. I currently live in Providence, Rhode Island.</p>
