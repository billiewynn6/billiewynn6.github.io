  <p>Billie Wynn is a multidisciplinary artist from New York City, currently based in Providence, Rhode Island, where she received her BFA in Painting at the Rhode Island School of Design. Her practice centers around connection, people, and embodiment. Working across painting, photography, sculpture, and video, she often incorporates projection, layered imagery, and found materials to create works that are tactile, personal, and resistant to polish. Billie co-runs Should We Gallery, a collaborative exhibition space committed to experimentation, dialogue, and community care. As both an artist and curator, she sees her work as a form of relationship-buildingâ€”creating spaces, images, and moments that explore the tension between intimacy and distance.</p>
